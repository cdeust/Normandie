"caen_castle_historic" = "Caen Castle is one of the largest medieval enclosures in Europe. It was built of Caen stone around 1060. It stood first and foremost as a place of power, where the Dukes of Normandy and Kings of England regularly held their major assemblies. A royal fortress in the Middle Ages, an English stronghold during the Hundred Years’ War, it was later to become the barracks of a major infantry regiment. Today this cradle of Caen’s heritage is home to the Normandy Museum and the Fine Arts Museum. The Castle has kept the traces of each of the periods of its history, like a trail of clues left by the passing of time.\n\nThe wall which dominates the city was drawn as early as William’s time; the towers, which have yet to reveal all of their secrets, have existed since William’s son, Henri Beauclerc’s time, although they also have traces of the Plantagenet sovereigns in the 12th Century and of the King of France’s engineers after 1204.\n\nYou enter the Castle by St Peter’s Gate, a barbican built by the English at the end of the Hundred Years’ War to strengthen the entrance which dominated the city. This ancient medieval door with its drawbridge was transformed during the First Empire to become the door to the Lefebvre barracks.\n\nSaint George’s Church recalls the existence of the medieval parish and is located just in front of the Governor’s Lodge, which was the symbol of power at the time. On the other side of the Castle, the Field Gate was protected by a barbican similar to that at St Peter’s Gate. One of the most spectacular views to be had is from above the large moat.\n\nThe façade of the Exchequer Hall is a unique reference to the architecture of 12th Century Anglo-Norman palaces. It was Henry the First, King of England and Duke of Normandy’s hall of honour, built dominating the relics of his father’s palace.\n\nThe huge keep, which was almost 30 metres high, disappeared after the French Revolution, but the wall and large moat, which the King of France had built to surround the keep after 1204, recalls, yet again, the tremendous power of Norman military architecture.\n\nFor a general view of this major site of medieval history, climb to the top of the northern rampart, which has been recently restored. The artillery excavation work completed during the restoration enables the visitor to view the archaeological relics, still undergoing work today.";

"bayeux_cathedral_historic" = "Bayeux was the seat of a bishop from the end of Antiquity and, under the dukes of Normandy, plays the role of second capital of the duchy until William the Conqueror transferred this function to Caen. This decision is in part motivated by the role played the Episcopal City in the revolt defeated in 1047 at the battle of Val-ès-Dunes. The episcopal seat remains however at Bayeux.  It is entrusted to the half-brother of the duke, Odon de Conteville. The first Romanesque cathedral was consecrated in 1077, but the works were begun under the episcopate of Hugues d’Ivry (died in 1049). The crypt is the only feature of this period along with the capitals of the vaulted transept. The façade north tower contains a vaulted room that archaeologists agreed to place at an historic date, in the years 1070, for research on the techniques of vaulting that will stop at rib vaults.\n\nAmong the most original elements of the Romanesque period, the decoration of the walls of the nave is remarkable.  This part of the cathedral is dated from the second Romanesque church, rebuilt after the fire of 1105, ordered by King Henry I Beauclerc at the time of his victorious march against his brother Robert Courteheuse. The works were to commence after the stabilisation of the duchy following the battle of Tinchebray (1106) and continue under the episcopate of Philippe d’Harcourt (1142-1163).  The decoration of geometrical motifs in continuous strips on the arcades of the nave is also found on the neighbouring churches of Secqueville-en-Bessin and Thaon.  But at Bayeux, it is really exuberant.  This highly decorated style undoubtedly finds its origin in the English models brought back with Henry I and that we see appear in many Norman churches in the first third of the 12th century.";

"bayeux_museum_historic" = "The most celebrated monument of Norman history is neither a château, nor a church, but a length of linen 68.80 metres long by 50 centimetres high, bearing an embroidered decor in coloured woollen threads.  Formerly displayed in the cathedral, the Tapestry became a public collection after the French revolution and is preserved in the Bayeux Tapestry Museum.\n\nThe embroidery narrates in detail the stages of the conquest of England by William the Conqueror, from the last months of the life of Edward the Confessor, up to the end of the Battle of Hastings.  The account concentrates on the role of Harold Godwinson and draws attention to the oath of allegiance of Harold to William. When Harold takes the crown of England in 1066, William’s response is to launch the invasion, which takes form in the Battle of Hastings; as Harold’s punishment.\n\nThis religious and moral dimension perhaps justified the presence of the Tapestry in Bayeux cathedral where relics on which Harold has sworn allegiance were locked away. It is thought that the tapestry was produced before 1070 on the order of Odon, brother of William, Bishop of Bayeux, who became Count of Kent where the workshops of the Abbey of Canterbury were reputed for their textile work.  Elements of the text and setting of the Tapestry attest Anglo-Saxon influences.\n\nBeyond the framework of the story and its motivations, the Tapestry also offers very numerous essential details on ships, châteaux, cavalrymen, arms, costumes and life styles, which make it a « documentary film » of the XIth century.  The Tapestry finally utilises specific processes of narration and has recourse to symbolism, like numerous literary or artistic creations of the Romanesque period.  It is therefore also a cultural testimony of the utmost importance.  The Tapestry is above all a monument to the Norman propaganda intended to justify the Conquest and to glorify William the Conqueror, but it preserves to this day its share of mystery and answers to several questions have never really been obtained.";

"honfleur_port_historic" = "Honfleur looks so utterly enchanting, it is hard to remember that it was built essentially for commerce. Its harbour sits in a great location, tucked away on the southern side of the Seine’s estuary. During the Hundred Years War, the French king had this strategic spot fortified, but that didn’t stop the English taking over for several decades.\n\nThrough the Ancien Régime, Honfleur’s shipowners made fortunes from trade, notably with North America. Samuel de Champlain, one of the most famous explorers associated with the port, headed off to found the Canadian city of Quebec. Lucrative lines for the Honfleur shipping magnates included not just cod-fishing off Newfoundland, but also the triangular slave trade.\n\nWith their fortunes, wealthy Honfleur families built their high-rise homes, packed tight next to each other, especially around the Vieux Bassin, the heart of the port, where a front-row home overlooking the vessels was a distinct privilege. Now, instead of receiving commercial ships, or fishing boats, which are kept out of the centre in larger docks, the Vieux Bassin attracts yachts. Shops fight for space behind the quays in this extraordinarily picturesque setting, while restaurants stretch their terraces across the cobbles.\n\nThe quarters on the different sides of the Vieux Bassin each have their distinctive character. The eastern Enclos, around the church of St-Etienne, is packed with interesting buildings. The western area slopes up to the splendid wooden church of Ste-Catherine, in a district where you will find the town’s main museums dedicated to the arts. Central Honfleur’s southern area is more discreet, but well worth exploring too for its architecture, including St-Léonard church and the restored fountains.\n\nHonfleur’s beauty has long attracted artists, with works to be seen both in the town museums and in the modern galleries that abound. As Honfleur is so clearly dedicated to tourism today, you can choose from an exceptionally enticing selection of hotels, restaurants and shops around town.\n\nAlong Honfleur’s stretch of estuary, you can stroll through civic gardens to the beach. Up the hillside, visit Notre-Dame de Grâce chapel and enjoy great views over the Seine estuary. From Honfleur you can also take boat trips out on the vast Seine estuary, or embark on a walk along the phenomenal Pont de Normandie that spans the Seine estuary so sensationally.";

"dday_cemetary_historic" = "The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France is located in Colleville-sur-Mer, on the site of the temporary American St. Laurent Cemetery, established by the U.S. First Army on June 8, 1944 as the first American cemetery on European soil in World War II. The cemetery site, at the north end of its half mile access road, covers 172.5 acres and contains the graves of 9,387 of our military dead, most of whom lost their lives in the D-Day landings and ensuing operations. On the Walls of the Missing, in a semicircular garden on the east side of the memorial, are inscribed 1,557 names. Rosettes mark the names of those since recovered and identified.\n\nThe memorial consists of a semicircular colonnade with a loggia at each end containing large maps and narratives of the military operations; at the center is the bronze statue, « Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves. » An orientation table overlooking the beach depicts the landings in Normandy. Facing west at the memorial, one sees in the foreground the reflecting pool; beyond is the burial area with a circular chapel and, at the far end, granite statues representing the United States and France.\n\nIn 2007, the Normandy Visitors Center opened. The $30 million visitor center was dedicated by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) on June 6, 2007 during the commemoration of the 63rd Anniversary of D-Day. The center is sited in a wooded area of the cemetery approximately 100 meters east of the Garden of the Missing. In addition to exhibits, the center includes three visitor films: Letters, On Their Shoulders, and Ok, Let's Go. Letters is shown in the auditorium on the lower level of the visitor center every 30 minutes.\n\nLearn more about the architecture, exhibits, inscriptions, and the project team.\n\nNormandy is ABMC's most visited cemetery, receiving approximately one million visitors each year. Due to the high number of visitors, forms must be submitted to cemetery staff for group visits requesting special tours or wreath-laying ceremonies. Download the Tour Request Form in English and French, the Wreath-Laying Request Form in English, or the Wreath-Laying Request Form in French.";

"chausey_isle_historic" = "The magical Chausey islands hide off Normandy’s most southwesterly corner of coast, 40 minutes by boat from Granville. The Chausiais boast of their diminutive archipelago’s dimensions, if a little tongue in cheek. They call it the largest archipelago in France… at low tide, when tradition has it that 365 islets are revealed, as opposed to 52 at high tide!\n\nWhat is certain is that Chausey, like the Mont St-Michel just to the south, experiences some of the largest tidal variations in the world. The statistics speak eloquently. The variation between high and low tide reaches up to 14 metres, roughly the height of a four-storey building. Even more amazingly, while only 65 hectares of land stand above the waters at high tide, 40 square kilometres are revealed by the lowest tides – that’s around 100 times more!\n\nAcross the archipelago, spot the odd monument left by neolithic settlers. Quarrymen down the centuries exploited Chausey’s stone reserves, notably to build the world-famous abbey of the Mont St-Michel. The main island, the Grande Ile, is the only one that is properly inhabited today, and fully open to tourists. The others are out of bounds much of the year, to protect nesting birds.\n\nThe Grande Ile measures a mile in length and is just 50m wide in parts. It offers a great variety of landscapes for such a small place, with many cliffs, plus bays with sandy beaches. Three of the latter are reserved for tourists, including the one lying below the former castle. As well as the island’s hotel, there are some gîtes for rent, two restaurants and a general store, though many of these close for winter.\n\nMany dwellings on the island are quaintly modest. However, several major 19th-century buildings stand out: the lighthouse; the fort, turned into homes for fishermen; the chapel, illuminated by lovely stained glass; and two towers, Baudry and Lambert. The last were long used as markers to separate out the parts of the greater bay that could be exploited, on the one side, by inhabitants of Granville in Normandy, on the other, by Bretons from Cancale.\n\nFishing is a major activity in these pure waters, including for lobster and prawns. Mussels and oysters are also cultivated on the immense beds exposed at low tide. The islanders’ typical boats are the doris, propelled with oars, and the canots chausiais, little sailing boats.\n\nYachts moor in the two glorious main channels beside the Grande Ile. Visitors can only explore on foot. The walks at low tide are magnificent, but always plan your outings with great care. Chausey, all told, is an elating, unforgettable, magically changing place to visit.\n\nThe Iles Chausey are the only Channel Islands off Normandy’s western coast to have escaped English clutches! However, the archipelago has been used by British sailors down the centuries. And some stone from Chausey, as well as providing cobbles for the streets of Paris, was even apparently used in building London’s quays";

"rouen_cathedral_historic" = "A church was already present at the location in the late 4th century, and eventually a cathedral was established in Rouen as in Poitiers. It was enlarged by St. Ouen in 650, and visited by Charlemagne in 769.\n\nAll the buildings perished during a Viking raid in the 9th century. The Viking leader, Rollo, founder of the Duchy of Normandy, was baptised here in 915 and buried in 931. His grandson, Richard I, further enlarged it in 950. St. Romain's tower was built in 1035. The buildings of Archbishop Robert II were consecrated in 1065. The cathedral was struck by lightning in 1110.\n\nConstruction on the current building began in the 12th century in Early Gothic style for Saint Romain's tower, front side porches and part of the nave. The cathedral was burnt in 1200. Others were built in High Gothic style for the mainworks: nave, transept, choir and first floor of the lantern tower in the 13th century; side chapels, lady chapel and side doorways in the 14th century. Some windows are still decorated with stained glass of the 13th century, famous because of a special cobalt blue colour, known as « the blue from Chartres ». The north transept end commenced in 1280.\n\nThe cathedral was again struck by lightning in 1284. In 1302, the old Lady chapel was taken down and the new Lady chapel was built in 1360. The spire was blown down in 1353, choir windows were enlarged in 1430, the upper storey of the north-west tower was added in 1477, gable of the north transept built in 1478.\n\nSome more parts were built in Late (Flamboyant) Gothic style, these include the last storey of Saint Romain's Tower (15th century), the Butter Tower, main porch of the front and the two storeys of the lantern tower (16th century).Construction of the south-west tower began in 1485 and was finished in 1507. The Butter Tower was erected in the early 16th century. Butter was banned during Lent and those who did not wish to forgo this indulgence would donate monies of six deniers Tournois from each diocesan for this permission.\n\nThe realization of the Butter Tower caused disturbances in the façade, which caused the reconstruction of the central portal and the west front, which begun in 1509 and finished in 1530. The original Gothic spire suffered a fire in 1514, nevertheless the project of a stone spire was denied and a wooden construction covered with gold-plated lead was begun in 1515, a parapet was added in 1580.\n\nIn the late 16th century the cathedral was badly damaged during the French Wars of Religion: the Calvinists damaged much of the furniture, tombs, stained-glass windows and statuary. The cathedral was again struck by lightning in 1625 and 1642, then damaged by a hurricane in 1683, the wood-work of the choir burnt in 1727 and the bell broke in 1786. In the 18th century, the state (government) nationalised the building and sold some of its furniture and statues to make money and the chapel fences were melted down to make guns to support the wars of the French Republic.\n\nThe Renaissance spire was destroyed by lightning in 1822. A new one was rebuilt in Neo-Gothic style, but of cast iron instead of wood. The cathedral was named the tallest building (the lantern tower with the cast iron spire of the 19th century) in the world (151 m) from 1876 to 1880. In the 20th century, during World War II, the cathedral was bombed in April 1944 by the British Royal Air Force. Seven bombs fell on the building, narrowly missing a key pillar of the lantern tower, but damaging much of the south aisle and destroying two rose windows. One of the bombs did not explode. A second bombing by the U.S. Army Air Force (before the Normandy Landings in June 1944) burned the oldest tower, called the North Tower or Saint-Romain Tower. During the fire the bells melted, leaving molten remains on the floor. In 1999, during Cyclone Lothar, a copper-clad wooden turret, which weighed 26 tons, broke and fell partly into the church and damaged the choir.";

"champdebataille_castle_historic" = "Jean de La Varende once wrote about Champ de Bataille « This is the realm of opulence. The decor is secondary to the declaration of power. » It’s this grandeur that inspired me to buy the property in 1992. The ravages of time had only very slightly affected this architectural oeuvre which has always been considered as a masterpiece of the baroque style, and which has been attributed to Le Vau, without formal proof, certainly, but with powerful evidence.\n\nConcerning the interior, apart from the magnificent staircase, only two rooms had been saved from ruin, the upper entrance hall and the « salon de compagnie »(reception room). Despite the degradation caused by time, their extraordinary volume and the vestiges of their richness provided me with the inspiration I needed to reinvent the palatial decoration of the Grand Apartments. I was thus able to correctly display the furniture and the objects that had been acquired over a long period of time. Most of them are pieces from Royal collections that had been dispersed during the Revolution.\n\nThe same principle of grandeur guided me when I recreated from scratch the gardens which had once evidently been sumptuous, but completely lost over time, even down to the last traces.\n\nOne solitary document had escaped oblivion, a sketch by the hand of a great landscape artist, possibly Le Nôtre himself. This document designated the layout of some of the elements from the period which we have scrupulously reconstituted. These elements, along with my ardent desire to rediscover the antique source, gave the measurements and the inspiration for the new gardens, produced by Patrick Pottier.\n\nWe set out with the aim to create a contemporary work of art in spirit but one which would remain timeless in its main lines. « The inspiration of the moment expressed by classic forms », such is the directing principle of this modern park, harmoniously blossoming in a classic, one might even say Roman setting.\n\nThus it is that the interior and exterior decors of Champ de Bataille took body and form, where the visitor can rediscover that lost feeling of atmosphere. Make it big and aim for the top: my perpetual ambition has found its absolute definition at Champ de Bataille, and I would gladly claim Daniel Boulanger’s saying for my own: « To embellish is to escape from the mediocre, to lift oneself up and out of the body. I believe in the sonnet, in the cantata, in the sixtine ».";

"gaillard_castle_historic" = "Established at the confluence of the Seine and a small tributary, the Gambon, the Château-Gaillard whose function was to prohibit use of the Rouen road and monitor the Vexin, disputed between the dukes of Normandy and the kings of France and recklessly conceded by Richard to Philippe Auguste in 1195.  The castle was in fact only the keystone of a vast presence locking the Seine Valley and including strong advances, the ramparts of the large villages (bourgs) of Vieil Andeli Petit Andeli, a fortified bridge and the royal manor on an island in the river.\n\nBuilt on a spur of the right bank of the river, cut off on three sides, the structure presented revolutionary innovations that made it a masterpiece of military architecture.  In particular the deeper extension of the defences on a unique junction: the keep, provided with a spur and solid buttresses bearing the first machicolation; connected to its flanks, its elliptic chemise wall with a enveloped profile to eliminate any dead angles; then a trapezoidal curtain wall flanked by four large round towers, these two outer walls one fitting into the other; and finally, at the weakest point, an enormous triangular fortress, supported by high corner towers and reinforced at its tip by the powerful bastion of the Mint (la Monnaie).\n\nThis Bastille; a sort of shield made inaccessible by a deep moat; stood facing the plateau, from where attacks would originate.  It is naturally on this terrain that Philippe Auguste installed his siege equipment, his archers and his sappers at the end of the summer of 1203.  On 6 March of the following year the Bastille capitulated, opening the road to Rouen and Normandy to the King.  The death of Richard in 1199, the passivity of John Landless, the insufficiency of the garrison, but also the presence of the neighbouring plateau, where the enemy was able to place its troops, was the reason for the formidable and successive defences of the Château.  Despite everything, this constitutes a sort of conclusion of the Romanesque military architecture and introduced a new age of fortified castles, marked by the tight and concentric formation of the fortifications and the contraction of the defensive perimeter.";

"jobourg_nose_historic" = "The Nez de Jobourg is the name of the cliffs, rising up to 128 mètres, some of the highest in continental Europe.\n\nThe vantage point they afford is used for an observation post for surveillance of maritime traffic. The CROSS-MA service, at 170 high, watches over the channel and keeps an eye on tankers and cargo ships as they pass the cape.\n\nYou can enjoy a panoramic view over the Nez de Jobourg, the pointe de Goury and the Channel Islands, from the Nez de Voideries\n\nAt the foot of the cliffs of the Nez de Jobourg, there are several caves, with highly evocative names which are the sources of legends - the Fairy Hole and the Cave of Lions, which have been shaped by the sea. Other caves like the Little Church Grotto and the Great Church Grotto connect to the town via a tunnel (according to legend!) and used to provide cover for smugglers.\n\nThe cliffs are a listed ornithological reserve, where shags, fulmars, herring gulls, and ravens nest.\n\nThe Nez de Jobourg is the second most visited site in the département of la Manche after the Mont Saint Michel.";

"harasdupin_historic" = "Louis, XIV King of France and of Navarre, founded his first stud in Saint-Léger, not far from Saint-Germain-en-Laye where he was born. Despite the prestige of the venue and the massive financial investments, production never appeared to give satisfactory results: the cultivated lands were hardly fertile, the pastures were too far apart and the horses were seldom in good health.\n\nIn 1714, François Gédéon de Garsault, the King’s first horseman was thus given the task of finding a more appropriate venue for horse-breeding. After first being tempted by Brotonne Forest in the vicinity of Rouen, de Garsault then came across the Buisson d’Exmes, near Argentan. This chosen spot was then extended to encompass the Seigniory of Le Pin, owned at the time by State Counsellor Béchameil de Nointel, who agreed to hand over his estate in exchange for other property located in the county of Picardie (North of Paris). On 2nd April 1715, order was given for the transfer of the initial Saint-Léger stud to the Buisson d’Exmes.\n\nNevertheless, it is only at the beginning of the 19th Century that we find, on Desessart’s plan dated 1807, trace of all the buildings required for proper stud management, witnessing the classic architecture of the Grand Siècle (French 17th Century).\n\nTwo names are linked to the construction of the King’s Stud, built for the most part between 1715 and 1736 in the midst of a 600-hectare estate (≈1,480 acres).When considering that the Château was built between 1719 and 1724, but that the 200-odd horses from Saint-Léger were already being transferred as of 1717, this leads us to believe that the main stable blocks were already built at the time, the Stud possibly having been constructed in two distinct phases.\n-Robert de Cotte, first architect to the Crown after the death of Jules-Hardouin Mansart in 1708, drew the plans of the central building. Prior to that, de Cotte had been involved in major royal works, notably in terminating the chapel at the Château of Versailles.\n-Pierre le Mousseux then used Robert de Cotte’s plans and oversaw the construction of the new Stud. Subsequently, le Mousseux worked for several years with Jacques-Jules Gabriel (who in turn later became first architect to the Crown in 1735), notably collaborating on the reconstruction of Rennes, burnt down in 1720.\n\nThe creation of a royal stud evolved by want and by need - to produce the best horses for military remount, i.e. providing horses for the army and the Grand Stables of Versailles.\nHence, the main activity of Exmes Stud, Haras d’Exmes, was to select breeds and rear horses, the better ones being kept for breeding purposes, with the others being sent to the Grand Stables of Versailles for remount and for Royal Order.\nThe last few years of the Ancien Régime were marked by the efficient governance, between 1784 and 1789, from the Prince de Lambesc, Grand Horseman to the Crown and Superintendant for the management of the Royal Studs, reorganised in 1764. Indeed, by Order of the King’s Council dated 11th December 1784, the Harbour at the Haras d’Exmes was abolished, the establishment being governed henceforth by the Grand Horseman. From that time on, the Royal Stud was exclusively devoted to the remount of the Province of Normandy.\nOn the eve of the French Revolution, the King’s Stud accounted for 196 stallions. In 1790, figures showed 40 fillies and colts on the stud, the majority being suckling foals, a sign of the formidable production dynamism.\nTo these figures were added 132 horses, known as « approved horses », owned by individuals, spread across the Province of Normandy (comparable to today’s French départements (counties) of the Orne, the Calvados, the Manche, the Eure, the Seine-Maritime and the Sarthe) and placed under control of the Stud Aministration Inspector.\n\nThe constitutive Assembly ordered sale of the stallions at Le Pin, as per a decree dated 20th January 1790. However, due to petition from the Orne County Council, wishing to maintain the stud's activity, 40 stallions were kept until 1793 when the sale thereof could no longer be prevented.\n\nAfter a period of uncertainty, the State-run stud institution and the associated stallion farms were reinstated by Imperial Decree, dated 4th July 1806.\n\nThe Haras d’Exmes then became the Haras du Pin, named after its locality rather than the surrounding woods, and was promoted to the primary establishment of the 1st district, located within a constituency composed of the Somme, the Seine-et-Marne, the Haute-Marne, the Eure and the Manche counties.\nEven though sold to private owners as national property during the French Revolution era, much of the land was bought back as of 1808, a time when significant urgent repair work was being undertaken on the buildings of Le Pin Stud.\nAside from that, the stables quickly needed to retrieve their life and soul: Norman mares and English thoroughbreds, appreciated for « their figure and their legs », as well as the horses repatriated in January 1814 from Borculo Stud, situated on former Dutch land, commandeered by the Empire and annihilated by the Napoleonic campaigns, came to replace the old or sick horses and even those no longer.\nThe Haras du Pin regained its role and readily coped with the impact that it was due to have over the French horse-breeding sector for more than a century.";

"norman_switzerland_historic" = "Norman Switzerland (French: Suisse Normande) is a part of Normandy, France, in the border region of the departments Calvados and Orne. Its name comes from its rugged and verdant relief resembling the Swiss Alps, with gorges carved by the river Orne and its tributaries, and by erosion in the Armorican Massif between Putanges-Pont-Écrepin and Thury-Harcourt. The river has created a rugged landscape.\n\nIn the hills, small steep fields are often bordered by thick hedges or granite dry stone walls and have dense vegetation. Mont Pinçon, at 345 metres (1,132 ft) in elevation, is the highest point in Norman Switzerland. Churches, houses and farm buildings have a style closer to what is found across the English Channel in the United Kingdom (i.e., stone buildings with slate roofs), rather than the timber structures of the Pays d'Auge.\n\nThe main towns are Athis-de-l'Orne, Clécy, Condé-sur-Noireau, Flers-de-l'Orne, Pont-d'Ouilly, Putanges-Pont-Écrepin and Thury-Harcourt. Some 34 communes are grouped into the Communauté de Communes de la Suisse Normande.\n\nThere are many outdoor tourist activities: canoeing, horse riding, rock climbing, hang gliding, kayaking, paragliding and mountain biking. Thury-Harcourt hosted the European Canoe Polo Championship in 2007.\n\nThe Orne River has carved dramatic meanders and gorges into the rocks of the area known as La Suisse Normande, or Norman Switzerland. The highest heights in these parts reach over 1,000 feet, making these the most elevated spots in Normand.\n\Sports enthusiasts will find plenty to amuse them in La Suisse Normande. The river attracts canoeists, amateurs and professional – the area even hosted the canoe polo world championships in 2014. Angling is another popular, quieter pursuit on the water. The rocks above attract rock-climbers, while hiking possibilities are numerous.\n\nLa Suisse Normande also has its relaxing sides, including appealing riverside hotels and restaurants and picturesque villages tumbling down the slopes.\n\nThe River Orne meanders its way through the rocks, offering a genuine playground for kayakers. And on the ridges and the faces of these Norman « mountains », you can also try your hand at climbing, hang-gliding, hiking... The Clécy dells also offer the ideal setting for a round of golf.\n\nThe perfect destination for a breath of 100% fresh country air.\n\nTake a stroll through Clécy ; enjoy lunch on the waterfront before heading down the Orne aboard a canoe. And if you fancy a family pedal boat tour, then simply head for Pont du Coudray.\n\nIn the summer months, have fun at the open air balls on the waterfront in Pont d'Ouilly, where locals and tourists intermingle in a natural and friendly atmosphere.\n\nThe brèche au diable (devil's breach) owes its name to a legend.\n\nThe devil is said to have spoken to Saint Quentin, offering to cleave through the rock to create a passageway for the River Laizon, hence putting an end to the flooding suffered by the church. The devil asked for the soul of Saint Quentin's eldest daughter in exchange. Saint Quentin accepted, provided that the devil whiten a fleece in the river waters and that he fill a vase with the same water, once the breach had been created. Saint Quentin cunningly gave the devil a goat's fleece, impossible to whiten, and a sieve instead of a vase. The devil, outwitted, created the breach but never received his reward.\n\nToday, the brèche au diable is among the fine regional sites you can discover over a walking tour. Take to the heights of Mont Joly and admire the breach from above: simply breathtaking. This is also the sport where Mary Joly, a famous 18th-century actress is buried.\n\nThe Pays de Falaise is home to many tourist attractions and historic sites, the flagship of which is undoubtedly William the Conqueror's castle. The year 2013 will mark the arrival of a brand new scenography at the castle, offering you a genuine journey through history.\n\nThe child in every one of you is sure to revel in the miniature railway at Clécy and the automaton museum in Falaise.\n\nFor your next family holiday in the country, take to Suisse Normande and the Pays de Falaise: a genuine breath of fresh air amidst nature's best!";

"dieppe_historic" = "Dieppe City History:\nFirst recorded as a small fishing settlement in 1030, Dieppe was an important prize fought over during the Hundred Years' War. Dieppe housed the most advanced French school of cartography in the 16th century. Two of France's best navigators, Michel le Vasseur and his brother Thomas le Vasseur, lived in Dieppe when they were recruited to join the expedition of René Goulaine de Laudonnière which departed Le Havre for Florida on April 20, 1564. The expedition resulted in the construction of Fort Caroline, the first French colony in the New World.Another expedition two years before where Goulaine de Laudonnière was under command of Jean Ribault, a local Huguenot captain, had resulted in the foundation of Charlesfort, now in South Carolina. Dieppe was the premier port of the kingdom in the 17th century. On July 23, 1632, 300 colonists heading to New France departed from Dieppe. At the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Dieppe lost 3,000 of its Huguenot citizens, who fled abroad.\n\nDieppe was an important target in wartime; the town was largely destroyed by an Anglo-Dutch naval bombardment in 1694. It was rebuilt after 1696 in a typical French classical style by Ventabren, an architect, who gave it its unique feature for a sea port. It was popularised as a seaside resort following the 1824 visit of the widowed Duchess of Berry, daughter-in-law of Charles X. She encouraged the building of the recently renovated municipal theatre, the Petit-Théâtre (1825), associated particularly with Camille Saint-Saëns.\n\nDuring the later 19th century, Dieppe became popular with English artists as a beach resort. Prominent literary figures such as Arthur Symons loved to keep up with the latest fads of avant-garde France here, and during « the season » sometimes stayed for weeks on end.\n\nDieppe was occupied by German naval and army forces after the fall of France in 1940. In order to allow a better defence of the coast against a possible Allied landing, the Germans destroyed the mauresque casino that was located near the beach area. The destruction of the casino had only begun at the time of the Dieppe Raid.\n\nThe Dieppe Raid in the Second World War was a costly battle for the Allies. On August 19, 1942, Allied soldiers, mainly drawn from the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, landed at Dieppe in the hope of occupying the town for a short time, gaining intelligence and drawing the Luftwaffe into open battle. The Allies suffered more than 1,400 deaths; 1,946 Canadian soldiers were captured—more prisoners than the army lost in the 11 months of the 1944–45 NW Europe campaign.However, no major objectives on the ground were achieved; in the air, a major objective of drawing German air forces into open battle was realized.\n\nFrench soldiers from the region, captured in the fighting of 1940, were returned to the area after the Dieppe Raid as repayment by the German occupation authorities, who felt that the conduct of the French civilians in Dieppe had been correct and had not hindered the defence of the port during the battle.\n\nThe port remained garrisoned by German forces until the conclusion of the Battle of Normandy. When the 1st Canadian Army approached at the end of August, the garrison withdrew, not desiring to enter into battle for the port.\n\nDieppe was liberated on September 1, 1944, by soldiers from the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. On September 3, the entire division paused for reorganization, and a victory parade was held; contingents representing all major units of the 2nd Division marched 10 abreast behind the massed pipes and drums of the division's highland regiments. A memorial service was held in the nearby Canadian military cemetery to honour those killed in the Dieppe Raid.\n\nDieppe Kite Festival:\nSeptember 1980, it’s the First kite meetings in Dieppe : participation of a half-dozen of European countries. The meetings will be renewed every two years. One of the main characteristics of the Dieppe Kite Festival is its international character with the attendance, to each edition, of about forty invited countries.\n\nEvery 2 years, there are eight hectares of lawn between the city and the sea which is available to the kite flyers and the public. This exceptional area forms a kind of natural amphitheatre.\n\nListed among the 300 biggest world events, in all categories taken together, this innovative festival presents all the kite disciplines. The best teams and acrobatic kite pilots, the best creative artists, but also a wide panel of traditional kites are faithful to go .\n\nThis free festival allows, thanks to many activities , to learn the construction within the framework of workshops, or piloting at sessions supervised by professionals. Specific activities are organized for the children, schools, and the underprivileged public such as the handicapped public . On the kite village, the contact with the official delegations is permanent.\n\nThis festival develops intercultural and innovative actions. It enables also to initiate an entire artistical work of creation and to promote world artists (sculpture, painting, music, etc.). The organizer team is also engaged in a reflection around the new technologies.\n\nThe festival of Dieppe, accessible to everyone, receive more than half million of visitors. It is considered today, given its international representation, as the biggest kite festival in the world. It provides the visibility and readability of the kite world heritage also the know which is linked to it.";

"etretat_cliff_historic" = "An old legend says that the village was founded following a Viking invasion. Étretat’s fame was settled in the 19th century when, from a fishing village, it quickly became a fashionable seaside resort. Little by little, the traditional activity of fishing was substituted by tourism. Paris and the largest cities in Normandy were not far and the construction of a railway line made transportation easier towards this little town. The train line has since been taken out of service, only to be transformed into a touristic train: le train touristique Étretat Pays de Caux. You can reach Les Loges downhill by handcar (6km) and come back by an old-fashioned train. However, one doesn’t come to Étretat just for bathing. Unlike other places nearby, Étretat does not have sand but pebble beaches. Here, the real features are the surrounding cliffs, one of the most visited sites in Normandy.\n\nOnce standing on the beach, the cliff formations are visible on each side: the Falaise d’Aval to the left and the Falaise d’Amont to the right. As it is surrounded by cliffs, the little beach is relatively protected from the winds. Many tourists come here in summer to admire the magnificent setting of Étretat, contributing to its festive atmosphere. Taking the shingle from the beach is forbidden as it serves as a protection from erosion by the sea. The beach is separated from the village by a long promenade, named « le perrey » after a local dialect word meaning « in stoned » (empierré). A « perrey » used to be the place where boats were running aground.\n\nToday, the sea-wall serves as a protection for the town from violent storms, particularly during the large tides of equinoxes. The little town’s origins as a fishing village are still evident with capstans and fishermen’s huts on the sea front, next to the beach. To enjoy a visit to the small but popular beach and the surrounding cliffs, it is essential to know the high and low tide timetables, in order to avoid being trapped between two cliffs by the rising tide!\n\nThe outstanding 70 metre-high white cliffs of Étretat are world famous and are classified as a national site, with its three rock formations, known as: \n– Porte d’Amont (the upstream cliff) – a large rock that juts into the sea, \n– Porte d’Aval (the downstream cliff) – arguably the most impressive cliff with its arch and needle, and \n– Manneporte – featuring a second natural rock arch above the sea.\n\nAs for reaching the top of the Falaise d’Aval, a very steep stair-path winds up to the top of the “Falaise d’Amont”. (You will need approximately 1 hour for a return walk). Here stands the Notre-Dame de la Garde Chapel, made of stone. In 1854, Étretat’s fishermen decided to build a chapel dedicated to the Holy Virgin, their Patron Saint. The Nazis blew out the building in 1942 and it was rebuilt in the early 1950’s. Behind the Chapel stands another monument, which looks like a tall white arrow, dedicated to aviators Nungesser and Coli, who were the first to attempt the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean without stopping. They departed on the 8th May 1927 but were never seen since. Along your walk on Étretat’s cliffs, many birds can easily be observed at a close distance: Common Gulls of course, but also Herring Gulls, Arctic Fulmars, Peregrine Falcons and Cormorants. The view from the top is outstanding for it embraces the bay of Étretat and the Falaise d’Aval with the Hollow Needle.\n\nThe Falaise d’Aval is reached by a set of stairs (180 steps) leading up to the crumbling (and windy!) side of the cliff. The path starts at the right end of the beach, where you can see remains of bunkers, part of the “Atlantic Wall”, an extensive system built by the Germans to defend against an anticipated Allied invasion of continental Europe from Great Britain. The local flora has adapted to the cold and violent winds hitting the coast, which have the effect of drying out the soil. This explains why the plants are smaller in size, as well as the absence of trees. From the top, the view reaches as far as Le Havre. But the eye is drawn to the abrupt cliff and the notorious arch, looking as an elephant dipping his trunk into the sea. Standing next to it is the “Hollow Needle” (L’Aiguille Creuse), made famous by Maurice Leblanc. The French novelist, a contemporary of Conan Doyle, created the character of Arsène Lupin, the Gentleman Thief and set his legendary refuge inside the Needle. Leblanc is not the only artist who found inspiration in Étretat: Monet, Boudin, Maupassant and Flaubert were also impressed by the grandeur of this part of Normandy. Several paintings from Monet were painted in and around Etretat.";

"stmichel_historic" = "​In 708, the Archangel Saint Michael appeared to Saint Aubert Bishop of Avranches and commanded him to build a sanctuary on the ‘Mont Tombe’ where the archangel fought the Devil. The victor over evil, it is also Michael who weighs the souls at the Final Judgement. His sanctuary rapidly became a major site of pilgrimage where men came to seek comfort for a good death.The sanctuary has therefore become a renowned site, protected by Charlemagne but also pillaged by the Vikings in 847. Rollon the First (911-927), then his son William Longsword (927-942), understood the spiritual importance of the site and rapidly restored and provided it with the monastery. From this moment on, the Norman dynasty would heavily rely on the prestige of the Abbey and the Norman knights would commend themselves to the protection of the Archangel who was also the captain of the celestial hosts.\n\nIn 965, Duke Richard I favours the installation of the Benedictine monks, architects of the new Abbey. On the mount, the physical constraints of the site imposed the construction of classical abbey buildings in superimposed levels, the church crowning the pyramid.  In the present building we especially admire « La Merveille » (The Marvel) (the abbey buildings) of the beginning of the 13th century and the Gothic choir.  Yet the nave of the abbey church shows a very beautiful example of the elevation on three levels of the Romanesque period and the Saint-Martin crypt or the church of Notre-Dame-sous-Terre are examples of the architecture of the time of the first dukes (10th century).  The Gothic cloister, where the columns of Purbeck marble (Dorset) support decoration in Caen Stone, expresses the richness and the prestige of the sanctuary that will continue to attract pilgrims from Normandy, England and from all over Europe. The scriptorium of the ‘Mont’ was, from the age of the dukes of Normandy, one of the richest and most important Western libraries";
